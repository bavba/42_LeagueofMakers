# LeagueofMakers (42 Barcelona)

Welcome to my repository documenting my journey through the Cursus at 42 Barcelona Campus. In May, I joined the Makers League, and starting now, I will be sharing my progress in my introduction to electronics.

# **Overview**

This repository serves as an ever-evolving page that reflects my growth and learning over the next two years at 42 Barcelona. It showcases the projects I have worked on, the technologies I have utilized, and the methodology I followed throughout the Cursus.

## **Projects:**

**Device to detect WiFi jamming attempts**

## **Technologies and Tools**

Throughout the projects, I utilized a variety of technologies and tools, including:

· IDE: Arduino.

· IOT board: ESP8266.

## **Methodology:**

To ensure organization and version control, each project was developed in a separate branch and folder. Upon completion, these branches were merged with the main branch.

## **Acknowledgments**

I would like to express my gratitude to the mentors, colleagues and staff at 42 Barcelona Campus, for providing an exceptional learning environment and valuable guidance throughout the Cursus.
